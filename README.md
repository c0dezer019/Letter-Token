# LETTER

Letter is an ERC721 token meant to allow the transferance of ebooks and audiobooks with the use of cryptocurrencies. Each token represents a single book.

## **The Problem**

Back in the day, audio, books, and other creative mediums were able to be downloaded for as long as you owned them. Now, largely, most dealings with books and audio are done via the cloud. While you can still download them, for as long as you own a legal copy or pay for services that provide them, you are stuck with them with no way to 'offload' them if you decide you don't want them anymore. Copyright is made to ensure you can't distribute or obtain stuff you don't legally own, and likewise, prevent you from sharing what you do own with those that don't. There exists DRM tools to enforce these copyrights.

Imagine that you own a digital copy of your favorite ebook, audiobook, or song, then one day you want to pass it on. Crypto is the answer, specifically ERC721, a Non-Fungible Token. ERC721, or otherwise known as EIP-721 is a crypto token that cannot be replaced with another. Each token is unique and cannot be copied, mutated, or deleted, unlike other Etherium tokens.

This means that 1 token can represent a book, song, picture, or maybe even in cases, a physical object. An NFT is a proof of ownership, like a title or deed. In a way, these are like DRMs with the exception that they provide Proof of Ownership. While this PoO isn't in the form of a piece of paper, digital or physical, but rather a transaction(s) in the blockchain, particularly the Ethereum blockchain.

#### **How is this proof?**

Transactions on the blockchain are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they have happened. Each transaction is tied to an address, which is in turn held by the owner in the form of a wallet. So, as long as the owner of an NFT retains control of their wallet, they can provide PoO.

#### **Is this better than DRM?**

It isn't on its own. DRM is a tool, and an NFT is more of a deed as explained above. But unlike DRM, you can use technology to make sure that only the person that has owns the token has access to whatever the token represents. You could tie DRM and NFT together even. ERC721 is only
